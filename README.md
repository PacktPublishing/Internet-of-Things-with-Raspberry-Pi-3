# Internet of Things with Raspberry Pi 3
This is the code repository for [Internet of Things with Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/internet-things-raspberry-pi-3?utm_source=repository&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=repository&utm_term=9781788627405), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
This book is designed to introduce you to IoT and the Raspberry Pi 3. It will help you create interesting projects such as setting up a weather station, measuring temperature and humidity using sensors; it will also show you how to send data for easy visualization. Then we shift our focus to leveraging IoT for accomplishing a complex task such as face recognition using the Raspberry Pi, camera module, AWS Rekognition, and the AWS S3 service. Furthermore, you will master security aspects by building a Security Surveillance system to protect your home from intruders using the Raspberry Pi, a camera, motion sensors, and Azure/AWS Cloud. We'll also create a real-world project by building a Wi-Fi controlled robot car via the Raspberry Pi using a motor driver circuit, DC motor, and a web application to complete the task.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
const server = app.listen(8080, function(){
var host = server.address().address;
var port = server.address().port;
console.log ("Example app listening at http://%s:%s", host, port);
})
```
